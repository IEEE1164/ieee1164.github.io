# gnuplot

The plotting software gnuplot produces publication ready 2D and 3D plots and graphs. Despite its name, gnuplot was not originally developed as GNU software, it does not even make use of the GPL (GNU General Public License). Advanced features like smoothing of noisy data, fitting measured values to expected graphs and parametric plots are supported. In the following examples the interactive features of gnuplot will be ignored instead it is used as an interpreter of command files. Since no default extensions are defined *.gp for command files and *.dat for data files will be used. This approach enables piping of gnuplot output to other programs as well. To achieve a consistent behaviour when producing multiple gnuplot plots for example for documentation purposes. It is advisable to save often used settings and variables/functions in a separate file. This file can be loaded via the load "init.gp" gnuplot command prompt or in production script files. For an extensive introduction see the book Gnuplot in Action
